### Geographical data for all political and administrative regions in Australia.

Deakin is a crowd sourced collection of geographical datasets for all administrative and political regions in Australia designed for consumption by APIs and apps.

It's 2014 and we still don't have a single collection of political boundaries for all local, state, federal, and related administrative regions, in an easy to consume format.  Deakin intends to fix that.

## Data

The repo is a simple collection of `.geojson` files.  Each file in the `data/` directory represents the jurisdiction of a single political authority, and contains a collection of boundary data for each division within that jurisdiction.

Files are named descriptively so that jurisdictions will group appropriately by the file system i.e. `au-qld-local-brisbane-city-council.geojson` and conform the the [geojson schema](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html).
